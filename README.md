## DSMCER Homework 2


### Description and purpose 

The purpose of HW2 is to give you practice creating plots. Aim to feel comfortable both creating a very specific plot, as well as making some choices to create a plot exploring a question effectively. Finally, you will run a basic statistica test.

### Instructions 

More details are in the Jupyter notebook for HW2. Follow through the notebook and complete all your work there. When you are done, `commit` and `push` your work. 

After you feel finished with your notebook, `run kernel > restart and run all cells` in order to satisfy yourself that everything runs properly in order. This is what we will do to check that your code runs.

### A note about comments

Comments in python (using # in a code cell - or just adding a markdown cell) is critical so I can follow your work. You can't really over-comment things.
