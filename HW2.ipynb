    "**1a)** Use the HCEPDB file you have downloaded with your `setup.sh` script from SEDS-HW1. Create a single 2x2 composite plot (*not 4 separate figures*).  The plots should contain the following data\n",
    "* Upper-left: PCE vs VOC \n",
    "* Upper-right: PCE vs JCS \n",
    "* Lower-left: E_HOMO vs VOC\n",
    "* Lower-right: E_LUMO vs PCE \n",

    "**Note well:** You should make the plots the **highest quality possible** and, in your judgement, **ready for inclusion in a formal report or publication**. Ensure that you follow the criteria of readability, audience and showmanship as was discussed in class. You should choose the type of plot which best represents your data.\n",
    "\n",
    "**1b)** Create a markdown cell after your plot and add the following information \n",
    "* The five terms PCE, VOC, JCS, E_HOMO and E_LUMO defined above and listed in the HCEPDB relate to photovoltaic materials - define them as they pertain to molecules that could be used for energy conversion applications \n",

    "   * You should create a contour plot that draws contour lines spaced every kT in energy and stops drawing contours once all of the features can be clearly seen. \n",
    "   Note: This is a slightly different visualization than what we drew in class which used shaded coloring to draw the contours \n",
    "    * Annotate the cell so I can follow all the steps you are doing. The final energy plot need not be in kJ/mol (you can convert it to other energy or use units of kT if you prefer.\n",
